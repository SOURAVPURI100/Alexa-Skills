Alexa Custom Skills

I have built this skill just for giving a fun purpose to my Echo Dot.
1. I named my skill -> Ask Jarvis, what do you think about ____? 
2. For example, When you say Ask Jarvis, what do you think about Bob(or any other name)? Alexa will respond with some funny and insightful reply about that person.
3. I used a pretty random approach to come up with answers(reply) for any given name. 
4. It makes it a fun activity for anyone to know what Alexa thinks about him/her.
